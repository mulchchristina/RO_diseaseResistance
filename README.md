Disease resistance with short (illumina) and long read analysis(IsoSeq)for r. occidentallis

Project:
Development of genetic resources for breeding black raspberry (Rubus occidentalis) resistance to the large raspberry aphid Amphorophora agathonica

 

Abstract:

Black raspberry (Rubus occidentalis L.) is a US. Pacific Northwest specialty crop is prized for its unique flavor profile and nutritional attributes. A major obstacle for the industry is Black raspberry necrosis virus vectored by the large raspberry aphid (Amphorophora agathonica). Natural, genetic resistance to aphids has been identified from three geographic sources: Maine (US), Michigan (US), and Ontario (CA). Segregation of resistance in each of these populations was evaluated phenotypically by aphid inoculation. Expression profiles in 10 resistant and 10 susceptible seedlings were evaluated with Iso-Seq (full-length isoform sequencing). Illumina sequencing was used to study the differential gene expression patterns in leaves following aphid inoculation. High-quality RNA was extracted using a customized RNA extraction protocol. Differential expression analysis was performed to identify differentially expressed genes for each population. Differentially-expressed genes were associated with a variety of functions related to plant-pathogen interactions, establishing that the expression of genes associated with several different functions were altered after aphid inoculation. Identifying genes conferring aphid resistance has the potential to refine molecular markers, enabling improved selection for aphid resistance in black raspberry breeding.
